# Word Counter

##### C# exercise By Victoria O., Epicodus - September 7, 2018

## *Description*
_Word Counter_ is a program that checks how frequently a word appears in a given string. The user should input both the word and a list of words to check. The program will check for full word matches only.

**Please Note:** There is no user interface. This currently only includes logic and testing.

This is an exercise to apply and test our understanding of C# unit week 1 lessons.

Primary Objectives
|:-------------:|
* Did you submit your English specs as a separate text file (or README)? Was it committed before you began your code?
* Do your specs include specific input and output as well as a descriptive sentence?
* Do your specs start with the simplest case and progress to more complex cases? Do they cover enough different input values?
* Have all specs been written up correctly as test methods?
* Are all tests passing? Does your method correctly return the number of repeats?


## *Specifications*

| Behavior         |Input Example| Output Example|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| The program should validate the user's search input. | "apple" | "apple" |
| The program should be able to validate the user has entered a list to search. | {"a", "it", "to", "a", "and"} | {"a", "it", "to", "a", "and"} |
| The program validates a word can be found in a list. | search "a" | true |
| The program is able validate and count the number of times it is found in a list. | search "a" | 1 (in a list where "a" only appears once) |
